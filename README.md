# Classification_Clustering
This repository holds a few different practice projects in which I created popular models (from scratch, without using sklearn) to practice different methods.

The first file containes 2 models created on a "Surfboards" class (forgive me, I was on my way to the Canaries).

The second implements K-Means algorithm using Spark session to speed up it's calculations and task execution.
